# Tic-Tac-Toe
Its a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game, play ad infinitum until you die.

I wanted to make the table of the game with numpy (I don't know why, but why not?).
I don't need to explain what is the game about, I hope.
I tried to implement all my knowledge to make this project. 
This project took me a few hours. However, I'm very satisfied because its the first time I made an own
project.


The input that the game needs is only one: a number (which represent the row), a hyphen and another number
(which represents the column). Both number must be: 0, 1 or 2.
If you enter another input the game finish and a message with the times that won each player will be displayed.
If you continue playing, everytime that a player place his piece, the table will be displayed with the move the
player chose.
If the table fill and no one win, then, a message like "-----TIE-----" will be displayed.
If someone win, a message like "X/O player have won (number) time(s)"


Thank if you read this :)
